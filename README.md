# About this project:
*This is a mobile-first web page about travels, building on Tailwind CSS.*

Created to practice Tailwind notation, and get familiarity with its native classes.

You also gonna find notes about several docs like `tailwind.config.js`,  how to work with `package-lock.json` & `package.json`. How to run a build and even how to keep it active using `--watch`.

**It's still unfinished yet**, but i'm gonna update it frecuently.

Here is the Github Pages link for this project if you wanna take a look:
